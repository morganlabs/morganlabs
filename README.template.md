# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Morgan. I am {{ age }} years old and I live in Wales. I am a full-stack
developer with an undying love for the backend! I have used Java/TypeScript,
SvelteKit, Astro, (S)CSS, and more, but I have taken to learning Golang
receltly. I was going to learn Rust, but Golang seemed like a better language
for me and what I want to do at the moment.

I **love** backend development. If you're looking for an enthusiastic backend
developer in Go who is ready to learn and take on the task, let's chat!

*Unfortunately, I can only work in the Denbighshire area or remotely due to
being unable to relocate or drive yet.*
