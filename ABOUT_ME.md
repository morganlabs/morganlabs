So, you want to know more about me as a person? I'd be lying if I said I wasn't
flattered!

## My Favourite Thing: Music.

I. Love. Music. I love music so much that my choice of streaming platform, Apple
Music, has been one of the main reasons I have found it hard sticking with
Linux! I love organising my music and Apple Music is perfect for that, with
Smart Playlists and Star Ratings, my library is beautifully organised.
