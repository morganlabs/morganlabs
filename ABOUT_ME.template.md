So, you want to know more about me as a person? I'd be lying if I said I wasn't
flattered!

## My Favourite Thing: Music.

I. Love. Music. I love music so much that my choice of streaming platform, Apple
Music, has been one of the main reasons I have found it hard sticking with
Linux! I love organising my music and Apple Music is perfect for that, with
Smart Playlists and Star Ratings, my library is beautifully organised.

You can read about my love for Apple Music

According to my [last.fm profile](https://last.fm/user/morganlabs), my top 5
artists in the past 6 months are:

{{ topArtists }}

And my top 5 tracks from the same period are:

**Fun Fact:** All of that information was pulled directly from the LastFM API
and written to every midnight automatically using Mustache! You can see the
Mustache code I use in this very repository!
